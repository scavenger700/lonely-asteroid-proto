        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm <b>S. Harris</b>, aka <b>alignmentDev</b>. I'm a soon-to-be-graduating Computer Science major at the University of Washington, with an interest in games, web development, and the internet.</p>

        <h2>Projects I've Worked On</h2>
        <h3>Bug Hunt (2025)</h3>
	<smaller><p><b><a href="https://state0fflux.itch.io/bug-hunt">itch.io</a></b> | <b><a href="https://github.com/State0fFlux/Garden-Scavenger-Hunt">Github Repository</a></b></p></smaller>
        <p>A cozy short 3D game about catching bugs. My contributions were mainly on the player character and NPC models: modifying the mesh, rigging, texturing, etc. in Blender, as well as integrating the model and animations into the game in Unity.</p>
        <h3>ChiveGen (2022-)</h3>
        <smaller><p><b><a href="https://github.com/alignmentdev/chivegen">Github Repository</a><!-- | <a href=#>Homepage</a> | <a href=#>Demo</a>--></b></p></smaller>
        <p>A static site generator (SSG) designed for online fiction archives, written in Java. Started as a solo personal project for fun in 2022, and has been sporadically updated and improved since. Will be getting its own site someday, hopefully soon.</p>

      <h2>Cool Courses I've Taken</h2>
      <h3>CSE 484: Computer Security and Privacy</h3>
      <p>Exciting stuff, for a variety of reasons. Security is a fast-moving field, and our professor had a lot of interesting personal insights.</p>
      <h3>CSE 461: Introduction to Computer Communication Networks</h3>
      <p>The course I made this site for!</p>
      <h3>CSE 457: Computer Graphics</h3>
      <p>Math-heavy, but it was worth it for the cool demos and projects. Also doubled as a crash course in Unity and Blender.</p>
      <h3>CSE 344: Introduction to Data Management</h3>
      <p>An introduction to databases. I hope to put the knowledge of SQL it gave me to good use.</p>
      <h3>CSE 451: Introduction to Operating Systems</h3>
      <p>A really neat experience seeing how things work just under the hood. Our professor had a lot of fun anecdotes about early Windows and NTFS.</p>
